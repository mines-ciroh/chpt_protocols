#### Overview
The US NOAA Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology (CIROH) is a consortium of US institutions (academic, private, non-profit) that collectively partner with the US National Water Center (NWC) to conduct research to advance operational hydrologic forecasting services. One CIROH project that is being conducted at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) is the CIROH Hydrologic Prediction Testbed (CHPT) -- a community-oriented initiative to establish rigorous, quantitative intercomparison and benchmarking of US operational hydrologic forecasts, and particularly the multiple elements – models, methods, datasets – involved in producing them. The Testbed’s overarching goal is to address the problematic lack of coherence of research into fundamental challenges and needs for operational prediction systems, which is a significant impediment to intercomparison, benchmarking, and synergistic learning across diverse investments into forecasting research and development. 

The CHPT promotes a multi-faceted benchmark-oriented paradigm through facilitating the use of multiple community-based experimental protocols with standardized evaluation tools, targeting different forecasting and forecasting sub-component objectives. Examples of sub-components include model formulations, model parameterizations (e.g., a glacier physics algorithm), input datasets, and techniques (e.g., data assimilation, post-processing, ensemble methods), across timescales from nowcasting to multi-season prediction. 

This repository contains the different protocols (in various document forms) being developed for the CHPT.  The effort is open to collaborators both within and beyond CIROH.  

#### Protocol Elements
* Objective or focus:  e.g., predictands, analyses, forecast information
* Observational datasets that can be used for validation and verification
* Reference capabilities against which to assess strength of innovation (i.e., the baselines)
* Experimental design:  the periods, catchments or domain, lead times if applicable, and other relevant details to ensure consistency in evaluating candidate innovations 
* Metrics of performance (absolute and relative)
* Other factors to be taken into consideration in the capability evaluation (e.g., computational expense, portability, complexity, dependencies, CONUS-wide relevance, potential operational latency, and so on)
* Key references, studies, and relevant external activities
* Contact(s):  Lead(s) or active contributors, e.g., helping connect new participants, identify new relevant work, ensuring that testbed results are up-to-date, and so on. 
* Metadata:  Machine-readable information structure to exactly identify each element used in each innovation within a protocol, including details such as model or dataset version, algorithm variation, parameter set variation, generation date, author, among others.
